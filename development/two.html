    <h1>Getting to Know You</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Many people struggle to find their purpose in life because they don’t spend enough quality time with themselves. The speaker emphasizes that just like you would need to spend time with someone to truly understand them, you need to spend undistracted time with yourself to uncover your own desires, passions, and goals.</li>
        <li>They clarify that activities like walking the dog or going to the gym don’t count as alone time since your focus is on external tasks. Real alone time means sitting quietly without distractions—no music, no podcasts, no books—and having an honest conversation with yourself. Initially, these conversations might be light and surface-level, but over time, they can become deeper and more insightful.</li>
        <li>The speaker urges people to prioritize these five-minute daily self-reflections. If we can make time for social engagements lasting hours, surely we can carve out a few minutes daily for self-exploration. During these moments, ask yourself meaningful questions like:
            <ul>
                <li>What do I love?</li>
                <li>What matters most to me?</li>
                <li>What am I passionate about?</li>
                <li>What legacy do I want to leave behind?</li>
            </ul>
            By consistently engaging in this practice, you’ll gradually uncover your life’s purpose.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong>
            To discover your purpose, prioritize quiet time with yourself, ask meaningful questions, and get to know who you truly are.</li>
